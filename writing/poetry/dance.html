            <h2>A God Dances Within You</h2>
            <pre>
Blasphemed, laughing, heaving clouds --
See the candle burning deep,
Watch the wick as it burns out.
Laughing, raucous, sundered sea --
A nauseating melody,
A distant -- closing -- certainty.

From his windward tidal throne:
A brambled mass of maw and bones,
He that shatters, he devours,
All the world which breaks and clamors.

He has come to take you home,
To plunge into the shrieking schism
Where the creaking of the prison --
He that walks in every dream
Where they that scream and laugh and scream.

With a vicious grinning groan,
He has come to take you home --
With manacles a-clattering
A deathly drowsing rattling,
Embrittled irons clanging
An awful draining banging,
A prophecy entombing
To a certain fateful dooming.

From the umbra, coming, creeping,
Grasping, breaching, sinking, seeping,
Weighing anchor, soul unweaving,
Dragging down into the deeping
In a cunning, reaping hold,
Like the crushing, seizing cold,
Like the prophecy foretold --
You are deep.



And in these drowning waters
Where the darkness watching never falters
Comes the hope that flickers
From the dreaming of the augur.

What sweet dove could hope provide?
No fire in this place to guide,
No boundless truth to give us proof
Except what pooled in your eyes.

No sleep can ever last forever;
No fate can be forewritten.
That gleaming spark did not surrender --
Wake and burn in opposition.

Orthogonal against the throne;
This growing fire, ever higher,
Rise and writhe and roam and rise
Against the windward facing tides
Like those spears ever-reaching,
In their hubris, in their dreaming,
Like silver arrows screeching,
Never stopping in their seeking,
Like the parthenon intoning
For the glory of the morning --

We will rise!
