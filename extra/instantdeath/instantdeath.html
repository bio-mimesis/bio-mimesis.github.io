                <div class="magic">All the world will be your enemy, Prince with a Thousand Enemies, and whenever they catch you, they will kill you. But first...they must catch you.</div>
                <div class="magic">The sacrifice of oneself to the pursuit of knowledge is the highest tribute to the gods.</div>
                <div class="magic">Some actions, once taken, can never be taken back. Be careful.</div>
                <div class="magic">The sun stops spinning when you stop believing.</div>
                <div class="magic">Surely...how? To see slow plants grow slowly from trash, how wonderful that could be! On the sun a house in the moon. You were close to a lamp lit river. You vanish through a cruel glass. How can you say that? How?</div>
                <div class="separator">╟§§╢</div>
                <div class="magic">Kingmaker, cubs left alone grow fangs.</div>
                <div class="magic">There is pure metal in the heart of every person, and it is blasphemy to pound away at it cold before you expose it to the open flame.</div>
                <div class="magic">Hating yourself just for having some feelings is not reasonable. It's not. Never give in to hate.</div>
                <div class="magic">If you do not have a part to play, seize one.</div>
                <div class="magic">Dispel ⌠÷⌡ Star-days</div>
                <div class="separator">╟§§╢</div>
                <div class="magic">I wish I could believe there was a different end to this story. But once you skip to the end, you can never return the knowledge you gained, no matter how you beg and plead to forget.</div>
                <div class="magic">It is a privilege to be allowed to be kind. Seize that privilege, and you will be broken.</div>
                <div class="magic">"A soul?" cried the nurse, bending over a register and leafing hastily through it. "But you've already had one," she said, as her finger stopped above a name which must have been mine. "What did you do with it?" And her pitiless look had me trembling in fear.</div>
                <div class="magic">One day, you put down your tools, decided you'd had enough, and let time pass you by, ever so gently and infinitely cruel.</div>
                <div class="magic">Get up. There's work to be done — cold, bitter work, meant for your hands alone.</div>
                <div class="magic">Embrace your fate, as I have mine.</div>
                <div class="magic">Never lose the love that dwells within you. Hold it tight to your bosom, and the gods will be in fear of your heresy.</div>
